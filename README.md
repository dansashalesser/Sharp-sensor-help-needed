# Sharp-sensor-help-needed
Greetings!
Sorry to reach you this way. I'm working on my thesis, which involves Sharp sensors and Arduino boards. I've been trying to get the Sharp GP2Y1030AU0F dust sensor to work with an Arduino, but am having complications
I've tried everything but it all leads back to your work on the Sharp sensors.
Would it be possible for you to take a look at my work and see if I followed your guide correctly? 
I'll be happy to send you all the details, you can send me an email if you'd be inclined to help:

Thank you in advance!
Dan
